# player-timetrack
This plugin retrieve player spent time on server then store it in a sql database.

You have to add a primary key to index id otherwise will not work as should, only one value will be inserted.
Before using my plugin talk with both webhoster and game hoster about mysql remote, if you have a free hosting
don't even think to use it because only paid hosting has mysql remote function active.

You can find a version without sqlx on alliedmodders with support for nvault.
